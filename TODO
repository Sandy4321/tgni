1. NEs with same offsets (A = B) :
  a. Same annotation -> Merge
  b. NEs with different annotations where one annotation is descendant of the other -> keep the most specific annotation
  c. NEs with different annotations that have a common parent type -> use the parent annotation
  d. NEs with different annotations (other cases) -> majority vote.
2. One NE included in another (A= Barack, B= Barack Obama or A= Obama, B= Barack Obama or A= Hussein, B=Barack Hussein Obama)
  a. Same annotation -> keep the longer one.
  b. NEs with different annotations which have a common parent type or where one
annotation type is a descendant of the other -> keep the longer one with its type
  c. NEs with different annotations (other cases) -> keep both NEs.
3. One NE overlaps another (AB= Barack Hussein, BC= Hussein Obama)
  a. Same annotation -> merge ABC.
  b. NEs with different annotations which have a common parent type or where one
annotation type is a descendant of the other -> merge ABC with the coarsest annotation.
  c. NEs with different annotations (other cases) -> keep both NEs.

* NOTES: USE BLOOMFILTER TO SEARCH QUICKER...

double falsePositiveProbability = 0.1;
int expectedNumberOfElements = 100;

BloomFilter<String> bloomFilter = new BloomFilter<String>(falsePositiveProbability, expectedNumberOfElements);

bloomFilter.add("foo");
bloomFilter.contains("foo"); // returns true
